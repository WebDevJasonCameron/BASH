# BASH Lessons

## 2022 09 14 | Nano, Really?
I'm wondering if I have to use Nano or VIM to create the python files for work.  This will mean I 
need to KNOW python like it was my first language. This is a real challenge for someone juggling 
python, java, javascript and the occasional HTML and CSS.

Found out that I can keep putty running if I use ```$: when true; do ls ; sleep 5m ; done```. I also found
out that ```history``` will give me a list of all the commands I've used in the past.  Then, if I use 
```!####``` I can call a specific command.

Started this work a few days ago.  This repo covers a lot of things we should have learned during coledge.  
Despite that, I'm learning this while on the job.  This means, I needed to buy a Udemy course (a few courses)
that cover more on BASH, Linux, and even VIM.  I'll be working on these lessons here within the bash_course
folder.  There is probably a better name for this... I haven't really figured one out at this time.

### 2100 |  Cont
Deleted a test.  This finally works in GIT.  Now I need to continue this BASH course.  Afterwards, 
I'll be including a new folder for the following Linux courses.  Aftwards, I'l create a new repo for 
VIM.
