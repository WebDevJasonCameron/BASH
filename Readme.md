# BASH Lessons

## 2022 09 11 | Created
Started this work a few days ago.  This repo covers a lot of things we should have learned during coledge.  
Despite that, I'm learning this while on the job.  This means, I needed to buy a Udemy course (a few courses)
that cover more on BASH, Linux, and even VIM.  I'll be working on these lessons here within the bash_course
folder.  There is probably a better name for this... I haven't really figured one out at this time.
